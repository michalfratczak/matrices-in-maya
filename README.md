# Matrices in Maya

[Original article.](https://romanvolodin.com/math/2023/02/09/Matrices-Maya.html)

Maya is a powerful tool that provides artists and technical specialists with a vast array of capabilities. One of its greatest strengths lies in the Maya API, which allows for the development of custom tools and plugins to enhance the software's functionality. However, even with access to the API, many developers still struggle with the concept of matrices. While they are a fundamental aspect of 3D graphics, matrices can be complex and difficult to grasp for those without a strong math background. Yet, understanding matrices is essential for creating powerful tools and plugins that can truly take Maya to the next level.
